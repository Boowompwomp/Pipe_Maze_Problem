This project was done as part of a job application
The problem given was a .txt file with different pipe pieces and XY coordinates. The Script had to be a single function, and needed to find all endpoints within the Maze of pipe characters.
The Script reads in all characters and coordinates then stores them in a grid.
Then it finds the starting character and recursivly searches throught the maze until all possible paths have been located.
It then prints out the end characters in alphabetical order.
